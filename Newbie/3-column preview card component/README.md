### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since React ive been using a lot of tailwind css and i haven't practiced raw css as much since then, so i believe those 'Newbie' challenges will make me write better and clean css.


### Continued development

as I finished this project pretty quickly, in order not to think so much, I believe that my code was not as clean as possible, so my next focus is to improve without doing so many code repetitions
