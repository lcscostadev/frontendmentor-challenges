## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Hover
- Root

### What I learned

Hovering, overlaying an image inside another image and box-shadow


### Continued development

Certainly this overlapping of images with transitions and hovers and the use of position

### Useful resources

- [BoxShadow](https://shadows.brumm.af) - This helped me to have a broader view of how my drop shadow would look
