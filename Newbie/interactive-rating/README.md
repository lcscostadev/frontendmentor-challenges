### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I've started with the css first to make closest possible to the original screenshot's then re built some things like changing the section to a form and make the buttons dinamically, then just finished using the ternary operator to make the swap for the thank page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I never did an interactive rating so I think what I learned the most was this, I thought it would be much more complex than it seems


### Continued development

Maybe in the future i'll make a hover slide transition when the user hovers through the star at the top, like a tip for him to select a rate.
